h1. mooCoder

h2. Description

This is a very simple online contest system, written with RoR.
You are allowed to modify it with the only one condition: publish your changes.

Thanks for troubletaking!

h2. Installation

You shall need a *Rails-ready*, *Linux-based* machine with *pre-installed g++ compiler at least*.

When you extracted sources somewhere, follow these simple steps to get started:

# @[su]#: bundle install@
# @bundle exec rake db:migrate@
# @rails server@

This will install application dependencies, start the application and get you ready with one sample problem.

h2. Updates

Note there is a newer version of this software, *(mooCoder 2):https://github.com/shybovycha/mooCoder2*. 
It is made with *Groovy* and *PHP* and is less platform-dependent.
